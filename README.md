# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

## Check-ins

We will be having a standup meeting everyday for 15 minutes to check on each others progress and where we are in terms of our plan, and 
we have scheduled times for reviewing our DTR and update what needs to be updated. Not to mention our daily work meetings.

## Project Organization and Workflow
1. [GitHub projects](https://github.com/users/Selena730/projects/1/views/1), creating tickets with different tasks and assign them to teammates.
2. Reviewing pull requests by the other team members (2 members) before merging them.
3. Use Slack for communication and for notifying the other team members about any progress, code problems or meeting times.

## Project Design
We decided to use GitHub projects as a tool to help us organize this project as well as using the school calendar to schedule our meeting
and standups. All of the team members agreed on the same things with the ability to change or add other tools depending on how the project
goes and what we need to succeed.

## Code Design 
So far we came up with 4 classes, to each it's different responibility, for example StatTracker is supposed be able to pull statistics for individual teams. As well as using different methods such as class methodsand object oriented solutions, and potentially using modules and other tools that we have learned in this mod.

# DTR
This is our first draft of the [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_vG66OgFbGIfTJ0koJnYsiMf2i6kMHXdGWDgNHCfx8/edit) template.
